\subsection{Controller performance}
As seen in the step response in figure \ref{fig:stepresponsebeam}, the beam control works well but is quite aggressive.
The controller being aggressive is mainly due to heavy integral action, which is a deliberate choice of ours, in order to manage balancing even the largest ball with acceptable performance.
